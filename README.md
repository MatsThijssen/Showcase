# Showcase
Collection of some of my past work

#Computational Physics
Contains all homeworks from class at NYU, as well as a final project (Barnes-Hut). All the code is written in Python, and each folder has an accompanying written report describing the physics and results/plots obtained through computation. Most of the code is not commented, though I might change this now if time permits.
