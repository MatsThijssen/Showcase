# Showcase
Collection of some of my past work from classes and research. Not everything mentioned on my CV is available, as some of it is being used for scientific work and can not be made publicly accessible 

## Computational Physics
Contains all homeworks from class at NYU, as well as a final project (Barnes-Hut). All the code is written in Python, and each folder has an accompanying written report describing the physics and results/plots obtained through computation. Most of the code is not commented, though I might change this now if time permits.

## Java
This folder contains a selction of finished homeworks from a class at NYU.

## NN
Contains a small snippet of unfinished code from my research project at Cambridge. Part of the neural network, as well as some data analysis code is added. Context might not be clear as data itself is naturally lacking, however code is commented reasonably well.

## Other
The code written in junction with my project at NYU is not accessible to me anymore. However, I am happy to discuss it in detail or provide references.
More work may be added to this as I practice my skills or undertake hobby-projects.
